     * DFS approach to count number of islands in a 2D grid.
     *
     * Summary:
     * - Treat the grid as a graph; land cells ('1') are nodes.
     * - For each unvisited land cell, perform DFS to "sink" the island by marking connected land as visited.
     * - Count how many times you initiate a DFS â€” each one represents a new island.
     *
     * Time: O(m * n), where m = rows, n = cols
     * Space: O(m * n) in the worst case (DFS recursion stack)
