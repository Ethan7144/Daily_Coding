     * Problem: Reorganize String (Leetcode 767)
     *
     * Goal:
     * Rearrange the characters of the input string so that no two adjacent characters are the same.
     * If it's not possible to do so, return an empty string.
     *
     * Approach:
     * - Count the frequency of each character.
     * - If the most frequent character occurs more than (n+1)/2 times, it's impossible to rearrange.
     * - Otherwise, place the most frequent character at even indices first.
     * - Then fill in the remaining characters in the remaining even and then odd indices.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     *   - Counting frequency: O(n)
     *   - Placing characters: O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
     *   - Only 26 lowercase letters â†’ constant size map
